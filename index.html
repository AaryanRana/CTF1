  <h1 class="h" ><b>INTRODUCTION</h1></b>
   <P class="hey">Hello, dear readers! My name is Aaryan Ranabhat, and I'm delighted to share my journey with you. As a 15-year-old student from Balkot, Nepal, my life revolves around exploration, learning, and coding.As I entered my teenage years, my interest in coding blossomed. I was captivated by the idea of creating something out of nothing, of bringing my imagination to life through lines of code. </P>
   <p class="hey">Mount View English Boarding School became my second home, where I not only pursued academic excellence but also delved deeper into my passion for coding. I joined coding clubs and participated in hackathons, relishing every opportunity to sharpen my skills and collaborate with like-minded peers.As I look to the future, I am filled with excitement and anticipation. I dream of pursuing a career in software engineering, where I can continue to innovate and make a positive impact on the world. </p>
   <p class="hey"> As I continue to navigate through my journey, I am reminded of the words of Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work." With coding as my compass, I am determined to do just that. Until next time, keep coding and dreaming big!</p>
